            <h3>Local Manufacturing and the Future of 3D Printing</h3>
          </br>
            <p>
              As a key driver of the fourth industrial revolution, 3D printing & digitisation is not only reinventing
                the way we manufacture goods and prototypes. In this talk, Dr Ben Redwood will be sharing with us
                the success story of 3D Hubs, how local manufacturing is disrupting both the industry and the consumer 
                market, reconfiguring the global supply chain. He will also discuss the impact of 3D printing on modern
                manufacturing and the future of 3D printing.

            <em>Dr. Eric Drexler</em>
            <p>
              Dr Drexler is often referred to as the 'Founding Father of Nanotechnology'. He introduced the concept in his 1981 paper which established fundamental principles of molecular engineering and outlined development paths to advanced nanotechnologies. His PhD thesis at MIT has been the basis for the book Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation. He served as Chief Technical Consultant to the Technology Roadmap for Productive Nanosystems; and as Chief Technical Advisor to Nanorex, a company developing open-source design software for structure DNA nanotechnologies. He is currently a Senior Visiting Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute and Oxford Martin School.

            <em>Prof. Harshad ‘Harry’ Bhadeshia</em>
            <p>
              Sir Bhadeshia is the Tata Steel Professor of Metallurgy at the University of Cambridge, and leads the Phase Transformations &amp; Complex Properties group. He has made major contribution to the field of phase transformations, both the theory and computational modelling. His work has helped in the large-scale manufacture of rail steels, and he has also developed the world’s first bulk nanostructured steel which was used to create the strongest armour to date. He led a joint effort with the National Physical Laboratory to build the Materials Algorithms Project (MAP) which serves as a centre for the "validation" and distribution of algorithms of use in the modelling of materials.

              Professor Dobson was the Founder and Director of Oxford Begbroke Science Park which accommodates new laboratories for University research groups as well as start-ups. He was the Strategic Advisor on Nanotechnology to the Research Councils and sits on several EPSRC panels and committees. Currently he is a Principal Fellow at the Warwick Manufacturing Group. His research interests cover most aspects of nanotechnology, and embrace biotechnology, environmental technology, energy, and materials science, especially in application to medicine. His research led to the creation of three spin-out companies:Oxonica, Oxford Biosensors and Oxford NanoSystems.
