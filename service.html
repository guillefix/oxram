      <p>
        As a society, we own some of the most highly rated Fuse Deposition Modelling (FDM) 3D printers that is regularly 
        serviced and calibrated to perfection. With years of 3D printing and modelling experience, we can also provide advice on your 
        3D models to ensure that they suitable for additive manufacturing. We also have a wide range of materials available, from the 
        usual PLA and ABS to UV sensitive filaments and conductive filaments.
