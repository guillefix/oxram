      <p>
        As a society, we own some of the most highly-rated Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) 3D printers on the market.
        As part of our mission to make 3D printing more accessible we offer 3D printing services to all Oxford students, 
        with a range of materials available. With years of 3D printing and modelling experience, we can also provide advice on your 
        3D models to ensure that they are suitable for additive manufacturing.

      <h3 class="ox3dpstyle">How much does it cost & where do the profit go? </h3>
      <p>
        When you choose to use our service you are also helping to promote 3D printing and robotics within the wider Oxford community.
        Any small profit we make from our 3D printing services goes directly into helping us run our society's activities, including our workshops and outreach events.

      <p>
        Our mission is to make 3D printing accessible for anyone. If you are a paid member, 3D printing for your projects can be absolutely 
        free! The cost of 3D printing depends on many factors including time, material, resolution requirement, and special requests (e.g. sanding, 
        acetone smoothing), so the best thing to do is to simply get in touch and we will provide you with a quote in no time!

      <p>
        Among our collection of FDM filament we have polylatic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PETG) in a large range of colours. 
        We also have a selection of more exotic filaments including nylon, wood-infused PLA, and UV-reactive filaments. For more information about the materials we have available, please contact us.
