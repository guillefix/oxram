        <b> Synopsis </b>
            <p>
            From the growing intersection of technologies such as IoT, Big Data, Robotics, Electric vehicles, AI and many more, smart mobile machines are developing. 
                These machines are able to interact with us and their surroundings and can collaborate, sharing what they learn about their environment.
                This talk will explore this intersection both in terms of what Ocado is doing in that space but also in terms of the wider applications such as with the future of mobility.
            </p>

            <em>Dr. Eric Drexler</em>
            <p>
              Dr Drexler is often referred to as the 'Founding Father of Nanotechnology'. He introduced the concept in his 1981 paper which established fundamental principles of molecular engineering and outlined development paths to advanced nanotechnologies. His PhD thesis at MIT has been the basis for the book Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation. He served as Chief Technical Consultant to the Technology Roadmap for Productive Nanosystems; and as Chief Technical Advisor to Nanorex, a company developing open-source design software for structure DNA nanotechnologies. He is currently a Senior Visiting Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute and Oxford Martin School.
