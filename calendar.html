             With thanks to the Oxford Foundry, we are excited to welcome Ravi Toor from Filamentive to give a talk on 
                sustainability in 3D printing and provide insight into setting up a company in the additive manufacturing sector.
            </p>
            <p>
            In late 2015, founder and director of Filamentive, Ravi Toor, recognised a need for change in the 3D printing market. 
                After studying an environment-based degree and having run a 3D printing business previously, Ravi realised that 
                the high quality filament in the market was not sustainable, and the recycled filament options were not up to standard.
                Upon realisation, Ravi sought to create a new brand of filament, which simultaneously addresses environmental impact 
                and the need for high quality to meet the needs of the 3D printing market. Used by more than 3000 makers, 3D Hubs, businesses and universities,
                Filamentive has become a main player in the 3D printing market – being named “One of the Most Impactful Start-ups” by
                Web Summit in 2017 and also shortlisted as a finalist for 3D Printing Material Company of the Year in 2018.

            <em>Dr. Eric Drexler</em>
            <p>
              Dr Drexler is often referred to as the 'Founding Father of Nanotechnology'. He introduced the concept in his 1981 paper which established fundamental principles of molecular engineering and outlined development paths to advanced nanotechnologies. His PhD thesis at MIT has been the basis for the book Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation. He served as Chief Technical Consultant to the Technology Roadmap for Productive Nanosystems; and as Chief Technical Advisor to Nanorex, a company developing open-source design software for structure DNA nanotechnologies. He is currently a Senior Visiting Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute and Oxford Martin School.

            <p>
              Sir Bhadeshia is the Tata Steel Professor of Metallurgy at the University of Cambridge, and leads the Phase Transformations &amp; Complex Properties group. He has made major contribution to the field of phase transformations, both the theory and computational modelling. His work has helped in the large-scale manufacture of rail steels, and he has also developed the world’s first bulk nanostructured steel which was used to create the strongest armour to date. He led a joint effort with the National Physical Laboratory to build the Materials Algorithms Project (MAP) which serves as a centre for the "validation" and distribution of algorithms of use in the modelling of materials.
