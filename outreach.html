       At OxRAM we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn about robotics, electronics, 3D modelling and 3D printing. 
       In addition to the teaching workshops we run for University of Oxford students, we are very interested in helping with outreach activities in schools and the wider Oxford community.
       In the past we have run talks for the 2018 Oxford International Summer School and have collaborated with the Department of Materials on their Making Materials Matter outreach project.
       If you are interested in running outreach activities and would like to collaborate with us, please get in touch.
